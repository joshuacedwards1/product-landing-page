# product-landing-page
I created this landing page to demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and visual design. I passed the "Build a Product Landing Page" freeCodeCamp certification project using the code I wrote here. For a preview of the landing page, visit https://joshuacedwards1.github.io/product-landing-page/.
